Layers

BezelFrame = White Frame about 1/2" wide 

TextTopLayer = Green Flourescent 1/4" Letters


T- ReverseTextCutoutLayer = Black Opaque
T- Text Support Layer = Clear 1/8" x 2 or possible 1/4"
T- BackLayer (Simple Trapezoid) = Mirror 1/8" Plex


T- layers all have trapezoid outline which fits in center of bezel frame where bezel frame overlaps OD and ID

OD overlap allows bezel to be inset within .160" thick Coreplast skin.

One thought is to cut 0.050 black strips to frame the T- layer stack.
