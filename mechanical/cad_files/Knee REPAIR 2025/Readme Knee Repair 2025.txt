
For the repaired knee inner yoke, 2025 Feb

The original "inner" knee has 3 pieces of styro foam.

I changed this up a bit including FoamRep component to be paired with
.175" thick piece printed on printer that would not fit entire part
(black component of the 2025 repair), but then needed to add another part,
the "Cover" to total the thickness needed to fit within the joint yoke.


And then if not mistaken, I printed a 4th part "shim" 0.13" thick to correct
for a measurment error...  What a mess..., but was out of time to get repaired kneee delivered for Feb Meeting... 


The replacement inner yoke if that is correct term  is a stack of three components.


The 5/16" bolts are needed to keep join locked in vertical position...


Stack if I have it right is:

YokePlate25_FoamRep_Feb2025.STL              PLA thickest piece with wire channel
YokePlate25_175Thick_Repair2024_Main.STL     black nylon carbon fiber with separate piece
YokePlate25_Cover_Feb2025.STL

Finally due to error cover extruded 0.13" to compensate for error, save time printing 
thin plate

YokePlate25_Cover_Feb2025_SHIM013.STL


Really entire inner knee could be printed in 2 parts, or a single part if wire channel not needed.




Hopefully this makes some sense if anyone ever reads this!
